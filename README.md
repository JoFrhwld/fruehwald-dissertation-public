# Josef Fruehwald's Dissertation Repository #


This is a public depository for my dissertation. I'll be storing code, data (when possible) and related papers and presentations here.


## "Public" Repository ##

This is a public repository, but I also have a private GitHub  repository where I am keeping my drafts and code which are not 
ready for public distribution yet. Normally, this costs money, but since I am an academic, I got a free micro account.
If you're an academic and would like a free micro account, check it out here [https://github.com/edu](https://github.com/edu).
